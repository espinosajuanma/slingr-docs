# Use `Execute in background` if the action takes more than 60 seconds

Just run to a *not new* error again. My action is taking longer than 60
seconds and exit with error.

```
ERROR jmespinosa@slingr.io Script execution time has exceeded limit of
[60] seconds and it is not running as part of a background job.
```

Remember to enable **Execute in background** option if the action is
going to be processing stuff longer than 60 seconds.
