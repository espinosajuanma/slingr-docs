# Separate `if` statement of conditions with a space character

I have to remember to separate the `if` statement of condition brackets
with a space character.

```js
// Bad
if(true) {
  return "foo";
}

// Good
if (true) {
  return "bar";
}
```

This is just a style. But I like this kind of rules because bring order
and consistency to the code.
