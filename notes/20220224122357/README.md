# Use `Ctrl+Y` and `Ctrl+{Enter}` to master the console

This new keybindings are amazing. If you want to improve the way to work
in Slingr builder you should use them.

- `Ctrl+Y` toggles up and down the console
- `Ctrl+{Enter}` run the current script in the console

Forget to use the `Run` bottom ðŸ¤˜
