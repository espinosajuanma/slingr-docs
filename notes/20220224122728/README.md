# `sys.jobs` package is overlooked, use it!

This package is use to manage background jobs. Always we run a dynamic
script at the console or a listener is triggered, even an background
action a job will start.

The Job object and a its methods are really useful to profile, debug,
make alarms or even do some logic to make an exit of an infinite loop or
a really long process.
