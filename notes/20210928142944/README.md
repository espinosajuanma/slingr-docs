# Notes when finishing a Story

When finish a story I have to fill two fields:

- Internal notes
- Customer notes

## Internal notes

> It is not for tell what I did. If I want to take note of what I did
> I have to add a note to the story.

Internal notes are to tell if there is something we need to have in mind
at the moment of doing a sync staging/prod. Or something we need to
know.

## Customer notes

This is to tell to the app users what they want to know.
