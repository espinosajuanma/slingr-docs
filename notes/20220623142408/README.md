# Users can be deleted only from builder, not Monitor

If you want to manage the users and remove some of them you will have to
do it in the `Users` menu at the builder.

The Monitor `Users` menu doesn't show the action `Delete`. This may be
something to avoid removing users in the production environment which
has a monitor, but not a builder.
