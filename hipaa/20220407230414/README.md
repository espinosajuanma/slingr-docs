# Penalties

Penalties are per day and per violation. This means that if we have
multiple violations we could potentially get fined up to \$50,000 per
day for each violation until is resolved.

- `A` - Did not know \$100-\$50,000
- `B` - Reasonable Cause \$1,000-\$50,000
- `C` - Willful Neglect-Corrected \$10,000-\$50,000
- `D` - Willful Neglect-Not Corrected \$50,000
