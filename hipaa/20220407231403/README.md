# HIPAA Security Rule

HIPAA Security Rule requires covered entities, business associates, and
their subcontractors to implement safeguards to protect electronic
protected health information that is created, received, transmitted, or
maintained.

It specifies a series of administrative, physical, and technical
safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
electronic Protected Health Information.

> Most violations of the HIPAA Security Rule result from business not
> following policies and procedures to safeguard ePHI. The HIPAA
> Security Rule establishes a national set of security standards for
> ePHI. Requires administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to
> secure ePHI supports the privacy rule requirement to reasonably
> safeguard PHI in all forms.

## General rules

The Security Rule requires covered entities to maintain *reasonable* and
*appropriate* administrative, technical, and physical safeguards for
protecting e-PHI.

Specifically, covered entities must:

- Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all e-PHI
  they create, receive, maintain or transmit.
- Identify and protect against reasonably anticipated threats to the
  security or integrity of the information
- Protect against reasonably anticipated, impermissible uses or
  disclosures.
- Ensure compliance by their workforce

## Confidentiality

The Security Rule defines "confidentiality" to mean that e-PHI is not
available or disclosed to unauthorized persons. The Security Rule's
confidentiality requirements support the Privacy Rule's prohibitions
against improper uses and disclosures of PHI. The Security rule also
promotes the two additional goals of maintaining the integrity and
availability of e-PHI. Under the Security Rule, "integrity" means that
e-PHI is not altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner.

"Availability" means that e-PHI is accessible and usable on demand by an
authorized person.

## Covered Entities

HHS (Health and Human Services) recognizes that covered entities range
from the smallest provider to the largest, multi-state health plan.
Therefore the Security Rule is flexible and scalable to allow covered
entities to analyze their own needs and implement solutions appropiate
for their specific environments.

What is appropiate for a particular covered entity will depend on the
nature of the covered entity's business, as well as the covered entity's
size and resources.

Therefor, when a covered entity is deciding which security measures to
use, the Rule does not dictate those measures but requires the covered
entity to consider:

- Its size, complexity, and capabilities,
- Its technical, hardware, and software infrastructure,
- The costs of security measures, and
- The likelihood and possible impact of potential risks to e-PHI

Covered entities must review and modify their security measures to
continue protecting e-PHI in a changing environment.

## Risk Analysis and Management

The administrative safeguards provisions in the Security Rule require
covered entities to perform risk analysis as part of their security
management processes.

The risk analysis and management provisions of the Security Rule are
addressed separately here because, by helping to determine which
security measures are reasonable and appropriate for a particular
covered entity, risk analysis affects the implementation of all the
safeguards contained in the Security Rule.

A risk analysis process includes, but is not limited to, the following
activities:

- Evaluate the likelihood and impact of potential risks to e-PHI
- Implement appropiate security measures to address the risks identified
  in the risk analysis
- Document the chosen security measures and, where required, the
  rationale for adopting those measures
- Maintain continuous, reasonable, and appropriate security protections

Risk analysis should be an ongoing process, in which a covered entity
regularly reviews its records to track access to e-PHI and detect
security incidents, periodically evaluates the effectiveness of security
measures put in place, and regularly reevaluates potential risks to
e-PHI.

## Administrative safeguard

**Security Management Process**: a covered entity must identify and analyze
potential risks to e-PHI, and it must implement security measures that
reduce risks and vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level.

**Security personnel**: A covered entity must designate a security official
who is responsible for developing and implementing its security policies
and procedures.

**Information Access Management**: Consistent with the Privacy Rule standard
limiting uses and disclosures of PHI to the "minimum necessary", the
Security Rule requires a covered entity to implement policies and
procedures for authorizing access to e-PHI only when such access is
appropiate based on the user or recipient's role (role-based access)

**Workforce Training and Management**: A covered entity must:

- Provide for appropriate authorization and supervision of workforce
  members who work with e-PHI.
- Train all workforce members regarding its security policies and
  procedures.
- Have and apply appropriate sanctions against workforce members who
  violate its policies and procedures.

**Evaluation**: A covered entity must perform a periodic assessment of
how well its security policies and procedures meet the requirements of
the Security Rule.

## Physical Safeguards

**Facility Access and Control**: A covered entity must limit physical
access to its facilities while ensuring that authorized access is
allowed.

**Workstation and device security**: A covered entity must implement
policies and procedures to specify proper use of and access to
workstations and electronic media. A covered entity also must have in
place policies and procedures regarding the transfer, removal, disposal,
and re-use of electronic media, to ensure appropriate protection of
electronic protected health information.

## Technical Safeguards

**Access Control**: A covered entity must implement technical policies
and procedures that allow only authorized persons to access electronic
protected health information.

**Audit Controls**: A covered entity must implement hardware, software,
and/or procedural mechanisms to record and examine access and other
activity in information systems that contain or use e-PHI.

**Integrity Controls**: A covered entity must implement policies and
procedures to ensure that e-PHI is not improperly altered or destroyed.
Electronic measures must be put in place to confirm that e-PHI has not
been improperly altered or destroyed.

**Transmission Security**: A covered entity must implement technical
security measures that guard against unauthorized access to e-PHI that
is being transmitted over an electronic network.

## Required and Addressable Implementation Specification

Covered entities are required to comply with every Security Rule.

> However, the Security Rule Categorizes certain implementation
> specification within those standards as "addressable" while others are
> "required"

## Organizational Requirements

**Covered Entity Responsibilities**: If a covered entity knows of an
activity or a practice of the business associate that constitutes a
material breach or violation of the business associate's obligation, the
covered entity must take reasonable steps to cure the breach or end the
violation. Violations include the failure to implement safeguards that
reasonably and appropriately protect e-PHI.

**Business Associate Contracts**: HHS is developing regulations relating
to business associate obligations and business associate contracts under
the HITECH Act of 2009.

**Electronic Health Record**: *(EHR)* Your health care provider may be
moving from paper records to electronic health records or may be using
EHRs already. EHRs allow providers to use information more effectively
to improve the quality and efficiency of your care, but EHRs will not
change the privacy protections or security safeguards that apply to your
health information.

EHRs are electronic versions of the paper charts in your doctor's or
other health care provider's office. An EHR may include medical history,
notes, and other information about health including symptoms, diagnoses,
medications, lab results, vital signs, immunizations, and reports from
diagnostic tests such as x-rays. Providers are working with other
doctors, hospitals, and health plans to find ways to share that
information. The information in EHRs can be shared with other
organizations involved in your care if the computer systems are set up
to talk to each other. Information in these records should only be
shared for purposes authorized by law or by the patient. Patients have
privacy rights whether your information is stored as a paper record or
stored in an electronic form. The same federal laws that already protect
health information also apply to information in EHRs.

## Benefits of Having EHRs

- Improved Quality of Care. As doctors begin to use EHRs it will make it
  easier for everyone to work together to make sure you are getting the
  care you need
- EHRs can be available in an emergency. If patients are in an accident
  and are unable to explain their health history, a hospital that has a
  system may be able to talk to the patient's doctor
- More efficient care. Doctors using EHRs may find it easier or faster
  to track your lab results and share progress with patients
- EHRs can alert providers to contact patients when it is time for
  certain screening tests.
- Less of a need to constantly complete the same forms

## Keeping your Electronic Health Information Secure

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 Privacy Rule
to ensure you have rights over your own health information, no matter
what form it is in. HIPAA Security Rule to require specific protections
to safeguard your electronic health information. A few possible measures
that can be built in to EHR systems may include:

- Access control tools like passwords and PIN numbers, to help limit
  access to your information to authorized individuals
- Encrypting your stored information. That means your health information
  cannot be read or understood except by those using a system that can
  decrypt it with a key.
- An "audit trail" feature which records who accessed your information,
  what changes were made and when

Federal law requires doctors, hospitals and other health care providers
to notify you of a "breach". The law also requires the health care
provider to notify the Secretary of Health and Human Services. If a
breach affects more than 500 residents of a state or jurisdiction, the
health care provider must also notify prominent media outlets serving
the state or jurisdiction. This requirement helps patients know if
something has gone wrong with the protection of their information and
helps keep providers accountable for EHR protection.

## Family or Fiends

- What happens if you want to share health information with a Family
  Member or a Friend?

HIPAA requires most doctors, nurses, hospitals, nursing homes, and other
health care providers to protect the privacy of your health information.

However, if you don't object, a health care provider or health plan may
share relevant information with your family members or friends involved
in your health care or payment for your health care in certain
circumstances.

- Your health care provider may share your information face-to-face,
  over the phone, or in writing.
- Patients give providers or plan permission to share the information.
- You are present and do not object to sharing the information
- You are not present, and the provider determines based on professional
  judgment that it's n your best interest
- Doctor may discuss your treatment in front of your friend when you ask
  your friend to come into the treatment room. Your hospital may discuss
  your bill with your daughter who is with you and has a question about
  the charges, if you do not object.
- Doctors may discuss the drugs patient's need to take with your health
  aide who has come with you to your appointment.
- HIPAA also allows health care providers to give prescription drugs,
  medical supplies, x-rays, and other health care items to a family
  member, friend, or other person you send to pick them up.
- A health care provider or health plan may also share relevant
  information if you are not around or cannot give permission when a
  health care provider or plan representative believes based on
  professional judgment, that sharing the information is in your best
  interest.

## Bottom line

HIPAA Security The HIPAA Security Rule requires covered entities,
business associates, and their subcontractors to implement safeguards to
protect electronic protected health information that is created,
received, transmitted or maintained.
