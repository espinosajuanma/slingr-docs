# HIPAA Security Rule

HIPAA Security Rule requires covered entities, business associates, and
their subcontractors to implement safeguards to protect electronic
protected health information that is created, received, transmitted, or
maintained.

It specifies a series of administrative, physical, and technical
safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
electronic Protected Health Information.

## General rules

The Security Rule requires covered entities to maintain *reasonable* and
*appropriate* administrative, technical, and physical safeguards for
protecting e-PHI.

Specifically, covered entities must:

- Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all e-PHI
  they create, receive, maintain or transmit.
- Identify and protect against reasonably anticipated threats to the
  security or integrity of the information
- Protect against reasonably anticipated, impermissible uses or
  disclosures.
- Ensure compliance by their workforce

## Confidentiality

The Security Rule defines "confidentiality" to mean that e-PHI is not
available or disclosed to unauthorized persons. The Security Rule's
confidentiality requirements support the Privacy Rule's prohibitions
against improper uses and disclosures of PHI. The Security rule also
promotes the two additional goals of maintaining the integrity and
availability of e-PHI. Under the Security Rule, "integrity" means that
e-PHI is not altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner.

"Availability" means that e-PHI is accessible and usable on demand by an
authorized person.

## Covered Entities

HHS (Health and Human Services) recognizes that covered entities range
from the smallest provider to the largest, multi-state health plan.
Therefore the Security Rule is flexible and scalable to allow covered
entities to analyze their own needs and implement solutions appropiate
for their specific environments.

What is appropiate for a particular covered entity will depend on the
nature of the covered entity's business, as well as the covered entity's
size and resources.

Therefor, when a covered entity is deciding which security measures to
use, the Rule does not dictate those measures but requires the covered
entity to consider:

- Its size, complexity, and capabilities,
- Its technical, hardware, and software infrastructure,
- The costs of security measures, and
- The likelihood and possible impact of potential risks to e-PHI

Covered entities must review and modify their security measures to
continue protecting e-PHI in a changing environment.
