# Who has to follow HIPAA

Entities that must follow the HIPAA regulations "covered entities"

## Covered entities include:

- *Health Plans*, including health insurance companies, HMOs, company
  health plans, and certain goverment programs that pay for health care,
  such as Medicare and Medicaid.
- *Most Health Care Providers*, those that conduct certain business
  electronically, such as electronically billing your health insurance,
  including most doctors, clinics, hospitals, psychologists,
  chiropractors, nursing homes, pharmacies, and dentists.
- *Health Care Clearinghouses*, entities that process nonstandard health
  information they receive from another entity into a standard, or vice
  versa.
- In addition, business associates of covered entities must ollow parts
  of the HIPAA regulations.
- Often, contractors, subcontractors, and other outside persons and
  companies that are not employees of a covered entity will need to have
  access to your health entity. We call these entities "business
  associates"

## Examples of "Business Associates"

- Companies that help your doctors get paid for providing health care,
  including billing companies and companies that process your health
  care claims.
- Companies that help administer health plans
- People like outside lawyers, accountants, and IT specialists
- Companies that store or destroy medical records

## Contracts

Covered entities must have contracts in place with their business
associates, ensuring that they use and disclose your health information
properly and safeguard it appropriately.

Business associates must also have similar contracts with
subcontractors. Business associates (including subcontractors) must
follow the use and disclosure provisions of their contracts and the
Privacy Rule, and the safeguard requirements of the Security Rule.
