# HIPAA Privacy Rule

The HIPAA Privacy Rule provides federal protections for private
protected health information and gives patients an array of rights with
respect to that information. The Privacy Rule permits the disclosure of
protected health information needed for patient care and other important
purposes.

## The HIPAA Privacy Rule

- Spells out administrative responsibilities
- Discusses written agreements between covered entities and business
  associates
- Discusses the need and implementation for privacy policies and
  procedures
- Describes employer responsibilities to train workforce members and
  implement requirements regarding their use and disclosure of PHI.

> The Privacy Rule applies to all healthcare providers, including those
> who do not use an EHR, and includes all mediums: electronic, paper,
> and oral. It gives patients rights to their own protected health
> information, access to records, and disclosure on how that information
> is used or shared.
