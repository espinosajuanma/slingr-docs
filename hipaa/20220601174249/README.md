# Ways to Protect PHI

PHI stored on computers, tablets, USB devices, must be password
protected, have anti-virus, malware protection, and encryption.

## Common protections

- Use password for your computer screen saver
- Never walk away from your computer with PHI viewable by others
- Close Doors when talking to patients and don't talk about patients
  around others or in public areas
- Shred documents that contain PHI when the documents are no longer
  needed.
- When you are not using PHI make sure it is locked in a filing cabinet
  and or office.
- Beware of "shoulder surfing"... People looking at your computer screen
  - Install privacy screens on monitors
