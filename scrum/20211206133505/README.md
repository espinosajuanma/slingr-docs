# `Scrum` - Sprints

Sprints are the heart of the scrum framework. It is just a time-box.

Scrum recommends from one week to a month. We have this time-box where
the team members will plan the work along with the product owner and
scrum master.

The team will deliver something called a product increment at the end of
the sprint.

The sprint comprises of all the scrum "ceremonies". So the daily
stand-up happens within the sprint as well the sprint planning and
sprint review.
