# `Scrum` - Ceremonies and Events: Review Meeting

The sprint review is held at the last day of the sprint.

The team comes together and scrum master facilitates this and invites
the product owner and the key stakeholders who might be involved in that
sprint work.

Based on what we did:

- What are the things that really got done?
- What are some of the things we didn't get done?

This is a very informal meeting. It is not a project status meeting.
This is for the team to showcase on what are some of the progress that
they have made.

The other thing to discuss in this meeting is:

- What are the potentially uses of this product increment that a team
  has just developed?
- What other products or competitive companies with similar features are
  doing?
