# Value: `Working software over comprehensive documentation`

> *Working software* over comprehensive documentation

- [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org)

It doesn't mean that we don't need documentation.

Let's no spend a lot of time just writing documents because the main
deliverable is the software.

The main thing is shared understanding. You can create this shared
understanding by actually just having more conversation among the team
members and with the stakeholders and potentially even customers.

In one way you can accomplish this shared understanding of the software
by creating small increments of software and giving it to the customer,
so we can gain feedback from them on what they exactly want out of the
software.

## Learning faster

When we create small increments of software and give it to the customer
without spending energy on huge documentation we allow to the team to
create something fast and learn fast.
