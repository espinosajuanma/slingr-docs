## Technical excellence

Thinks about quality. If you build something quick and without attention
to detail it is going to be hard to build something on top of that.

We make those features and functionality evolve. We are going to make
slight changes to them and additions to them to help drive value later
on.

If we have problems early on in that design, or in that initial quality
we are going to have problems later.
