# Value: `Responding to change over following a plan`

> *Responding to change* over following a plan

[Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org)

## Having a plan

It is very important to have a plan. But we value more to be ready for
changes and respond to any change.

## Changes

If we are developing a complex piece of software something will change
and the plan will not be useful.

We need some kind of plan but we need more to be able to respond to
changes as they happen.
