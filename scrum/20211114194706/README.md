# Agile Principle `#1`

> Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and
> continuous delivery of valuable software

## Delivering value faster

Instead of working as the traditional method (waterfall):

1. Design
1. Development
1. Testing
1. Implementation

Where the value is realized at the end of the project. Agile says: "try
to deliver value faster -**almost every week or every other week**-.
Where you can give some valuable feature to the customer and they can
give you feedback faster.
