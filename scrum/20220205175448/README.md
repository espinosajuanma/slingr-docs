# `Scrum` - Role: Development Team

The developer team are the developers, QA, architect, UI developer,
Business Analysts... Basically everybody other than the Product Owner
and the Scum Master.

When you are part of a team, it doesn't matter what your title is, you
are just part of the team.

As a team you are self-organizing. And learning from each other
experience and working together.
