As a product owner you are meeting with the business and then helping to
translate that into work units, user stories for the team to work on.

So a product owner is gathering the requirements and putting them into
work items.

> I can't always make the business happy because I understand where the
> project team is coming from but I also have to not just concede to
> what we can get done that need to meet the needs of the business.

- This is what we need to have done
- This is the type of functionality that is needed
