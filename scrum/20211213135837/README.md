# `Scrum` - Roles

## Product owner

- Talk to the stakeholders and users to understand their needs and
  vision of the product.
- Come back to the team and help the team understand the product vision.
- Also give the team some description of the product feature and what
  needs to be built.

The **product owner** writes a simple description of the product feature
from an end user's perspective (called user stories)

Also prioritize these work items (stories)

```
As a {end_user_role_} I want to {desired_action} so that
{desired_benefit}
```

## Scrum master

- Ensures Scrum is understood and used skillfully by Scrum Team.
- Servant Leader.
- Models Agile Mindset and Scrum Framework.

It is a *leader-servant* role that is there to remove impediments or the
roadblocks in the sprint.

Also coaches teams on the scrum values to live the scrum and facilitate
the various scrum meetings or ceremonies.

## Development team

- Build product increment
- Dev Team is cross functional
- Self organizing
- Accountable as a team
- Three to nine people

It is a group of professionals who are capable of delivering a
potentially releasable increment at the end of the sprint.

They don't need a manager to organize their work, they will talk among
each other and figure out how to organize them selves. Anyway they check
first the priority set by the product owner. In daily basis they talk
with the product owner to understand the priority and sequencing of
work.

They are also cross-functional. They have all the skills set that are
required to develop that product or feature.
