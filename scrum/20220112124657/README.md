# `Scrum` - Roles: Scrum Master

The scrum master starts the daily stand up asking to his team:

- What did you do yesterday?
- What are you going to focus on today?
- Do you have impediments?

The scrum master is a facilitator after all. So if the team needs some
data for testing, or some access to a server or to talk with another
team member to keep the work going and skip that impediments.

Also in the sprint planning the scrum master tell the things the project
need to get done and what is the sprint goal.

The goal is to help the team continue to drive forward and not be
stopped.
