## Building around motivated individuals

The project manager job is not asking questions as:

- What did you do yesterday?
- How much have you done?
- Or others statuses reports

The idea is to have motivated group of individuals. Give them space to
actually do amazing work.

Not only to develop software but also to solve problems for the company
or the client.

It is always about: *Creating value*.

Regardless of your title, this teams are cross-functional. That means:
they cross over roles. Your duties and responsibilities are going to
evolve and change. That is because everybody is collaborating together
working for that end value.
