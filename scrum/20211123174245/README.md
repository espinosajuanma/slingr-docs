# `Scrum` - Sprints

An sprint is just a time selected by the team between one to four weeks.
In this time they plan, get the work ready, develop, test and release it
to production. At the end of the iteration you give the software to the
customer.

All the meetings actually happen within the sprint. In this meetings you
plan the work, do a daily check, and review the work at the end of the
sprint.

You can also do a retrospective on how the team is doing in terms of
working with each other.
