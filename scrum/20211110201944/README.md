# Value: `Customer collaboration over contract negotiation`

> *Customer collaboration* over contract negotiation

[Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org)

## Customer collaboration

We want to collaborate and delight our customers. We cant them to back
to us and rely on our expertise for developing software.

However, we have to change the way we write the contracts.

## Contracts

In the past, most of the times, these contracts are written based on
business requirements or functional requirement documents which
throughout the course the project, it is so hard to predict.

Usually this requirements change and there goes the contract where now
as a development team we have to go based on the contract and the client
will actually have us execute on the contract. It is a lose-lose
situation versus what we are suggesting.

We need a contract in a way where we're keeping customer success in our
mind. It's actually not fair for development teams to ask for all the
requirements from the customer or the client in day one.

They are coming to us in the first place for help. They want this piece
of software to be built by us.

*Rather than putting them into a strong contract, we want to collaborate
with them and help them understand what they need in the software so
they can really delight their customer*

> Instead have a strict contract upfront, collaboration is the key.
> Work with the customer through the project and create a win-win
> situation: if the customer win you win.
