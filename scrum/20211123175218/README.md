# `Scrum` - Summary

Scrum is an agile way of developing software or any project.

Scrum is more than a methodology. There is a lot of utility if you look
at scrum as a framework.

## More than a framework

When you look at scrum as a framework then it is a little bit more than
a process.

It is more of an adaptive framework that can allow your team to become
agile and you can place more value on being agile than just doing
perfect scrum.

## Self-organizing team

Scrum highly recommend a self-organizing team and cross-functional team.

That means if a team is going to take on some work the team members
should have the skill sets to be able to develop the solution for their
work.

## Challenges

If there is a challenge or a conflict in the team, they come together
and discuss and decide on a own way to move forward as a team.

## Other fields

Scrum was initially developed to manage software products. But is also
used in schools and education, operations, startups, government, and
marketing.
