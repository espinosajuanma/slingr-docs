## Self-organizing teams

Depending of the kind of project we are working on, we are going to have
people with the right skill set. And that is what a team is formed of.

Everybody in the team has unique skill sets and they have what it takes
to make this project **successful**.

So when we need something, like a question about an architecture, we
already have somebody in that team. So we can actually talk to the right
person, versus asking someone else from other team.
