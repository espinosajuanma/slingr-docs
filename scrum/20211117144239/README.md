## Sustainable development

We think about key features. What we need to do. What is the team's
capacity. And think about a sustainable *pace* that team can develop
in.

In agile the whole team is getting together. It makes it more
sustainable, because the cross-functional team. Everybody is able to
help move that particular project forward to meet the value.
