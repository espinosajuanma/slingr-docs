## Manifesto for Agile Software Development

> We are uncovering better ways of developing
> software by doing it and helping others do it.
> Through this work we have come to value:
>
> - *Individuals and interactions* over processes and tools
> - *Working software* over comprehensive documentation
> - *Customer collaboration* over contract negotiation
> - *Responding to change* over following a plan
>
> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the
> items on the left more.
