# Value: `Individuals and interactions over processes and tools`

> *Individuals and interactions* over processes and tools

- [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org)

Individuals and interactions means that we value people and we value
interactions among people when they're developing software. At a team
level.

Also we value people interacting with the stakeholders or customers.

At the same time, it is important that there are enough interactions
between the team members or multiple teams that are building this piece
of software.

Processes and tools doesn't lose value because of this. But in terms of
"Agile" we value people and interactions more.

> We prefer face to face over sending a ticket
