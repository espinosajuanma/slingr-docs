# Challenges

- Change of mindset for companies that work with waterfall methodology
  - Change organizational structure
  - Change the way people and teams work with each other
  - It is an "all" or "none" process

For new companies it is easier because they don't have to change any
existing process or any adjustment to do. The company culture can just
be built around that agile philosophy and that agile mindset.

Since the team didn't make too much documentation in the process it is
going to be harder when the project is over. The support team doesn't
have any real documentation to know how the app work.
