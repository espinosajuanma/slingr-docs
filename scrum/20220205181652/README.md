# `Scrum` - Ceremonies and Events: Sprint Planning Meeting

In this meeting we are planning this time-box period which we call
"Sprint".

- What goals can we achieve in this sprint?
- It is going to be shippable to the customer?
- Would the customer be able of use it and give us feedback?

We are planning not just for developing it, also testing and making sure
the product is ready to be use for the customer.

## Scrum Master

Scrum master will facilitate this meeting. It is going to make sure that
everybody go to the meeting.

## Product Owner

The product owner is one of the main players in this meeting. He comes
and understands the vision of the product. He knows the needs and the
challenges of the product. He will tell which items are the most
important for the stakeholder and the priority of each.

## Development Team

Based on the priorities that the product owner say, the team will say
what items can they deliver in the period of the sprint. Making sure
they feel very confident about it.

Sometimes there are items that can't be done, and the product owner will
negotiate with the team so can work on this in the scope of the sprint.

## Finishing the meeting

After one or two hours of the meeting we should have a concrete plan on
how we are going to work and how we are going to create this potentially
shippable fixes, improvements and features for the application.

We should have a clear picture or goal for this iteration of the sprint.

## Sprint backlog

One last thing to remember is a sprint backlog comes out of the sprint
planning meeting. The sprint backlog is the amount of work that the team
members agreed to work on that sprint.

For example twelve user stories that can be done in the time-box period
of time what the sprint takes.
