## Welcoming changes

Responding to change is crucial for any business.

It is also about delighting customers as well, and really responding to
their needs.

In traditional waterfall development where a customer comes with the
initial set of requirements, and there's a sign up process. You do that
and then you can't really change anything.

In the agile processes, where you can actually change and you are *open
to change*.

Businesses are always evolving. Of course that project is going to
evolve and change.
