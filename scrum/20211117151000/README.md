# Agile Principle `#12`

> At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more

## Reflect and adjust

When working a project as a team, you are going to learn different
things about each other.

So at each interval, you can take note of what went well and what
doesn't. From there you can ask how can we improve.

With agile, being more iterative, every few weeks, we can be able to
look and see how it is going and make adjustments as necessary to make
the team even more successful.
