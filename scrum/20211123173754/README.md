# `Scrum` - Inspect and adapt

As a team picks up the work and they start working, after some time they
can learn more about the problem and the solution and a better way of
delivering software.

Scrum says you pick up our problem, you start working on and as you work
on it you can look back and inspect and adapt according to what you 
learn from the process of working itself.

Not only you can inspect and adapt on the problems that youâ€™re solving,
you can inspect and adapt on also how the team is doing and how the team
is leveraging the scrum framework.
