# `Scrum` - Ceremonies and Events: Sprint retrospective

1. What did the team do well?
1. What didn't go well in this last sprint?
1. What should be improved on?

## Scrum master

The scrum master is the facilitator who sets the stage for the team.
Creates the safety container where everybody feels empowered to talk
about not only the good things.

But also some of the bad things or some of the challenges that are
happening within the team member. Or some conflicts that team members
have. 

## Gathering data

The next step is gathering data. What happened in this last iteration of
the sprint? What are some of the challenges that you saw? What can we
learn from this last sprint?

## Insights

Then is time for the team to generate some insights. Like why did this
happen? Let's learn more on like the depths of challenges or the problem
that the team had.

## Learning plan

After we have a good amount of insights, the team will decide on how
they want to go about and improve.
