# Agile Principle `#6`

> The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to
> and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

## Face to face

Instead of writing a requirement document we encourage more face to face
communication. Or even worse creating a ticket, messaging them, and
bothering them all the time...

Just have meetings face to face, where you are able to communicate what
you need.

> All agile meetings actually encourages face to face communication.
